```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gte: 18 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  }
]);
```
This aggregation pipeline attempts to calculate the average age of users in each city.  The issue arises if the `age` field is not consistently a number; for instance, if some documents have `age` as a string ("25"), the `$avg` operator will produce unexpected results (or even fail to execute).
